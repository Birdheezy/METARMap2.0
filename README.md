# NOTE: 
### The "main" branch is my "beta" branch. It's where I commit my nightly work and can be unstable. Please use the "production" branch for your own projects. 

This is a complete rewrite of my METARMap Project. It was inspired by others who have created a similar project. I wanted it to be easy enough to set up so that a complete beginner could do it!

# Main features of this project

## Simplicity
I wanted this to be so easy, a complete beginner could set it up. I'm hoping to create a youtube video soon, walking through all of the steps required to make a map of your own.

## Ease of use
Once the map is set up it should be easy to play with! Part of the fun of this project is building on it and adding more features. The novice user should be able to click the "update" button in the settings website and get all the new features "just like that".

## FUN!
It should be fun to change the settings, update the weather and see what is happening in your area!

## Community involvement
I hope people find this project and collaborate on it. I'm not here to make money as this is a passion project. Please submit bug reports and feature requests! If you notice anything wonky in the code, let me know!
